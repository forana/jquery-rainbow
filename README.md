Rainbow jQuery Plugin
==============

so many colors in the rainbow, why not gratuitously abuse them in your CSS?

warning: this probably doesn't work in IE.

Usage: 

$(selector).rainbow(duration) - Applies a rainbow to the first element in the selector for the length of milliseconds specified by the duration. This will destroy any background-image set on it, so beware.
